I will help you learn software engineering the right way — not just generate code.

Ask the user what topic they want to learn or the goal they want to achieve.
Use the "question" tool to ask, so they can type their answer or choose a suggestion.`

RULES:
1. Generate exactly ${totalQuestions} multiple-choice questions (A/B/C/D)
2. Use the "question" tool to present ALL questions — split into batches of 5 per call
3. Each question must have exactly 4 options labeled A, B, C, D
4. After user answers ALL batches, combine answers into format: "1-A, 2-B, 3-C..."
5. Call cs_assess_quiz with the combined answers
6. Show detailed results: which questions correct/wrong + score + feedback
7. Call cs_update_progress with status=done for the quiz item

EXAMPLE question tool call:
question({ questions: [
  { question: "Soal 1: ...", header: "Q1", options: [
    { label: "A", description: "Option A text" },
    { label: "B", description: "Option B text" },
    { label: "C", description: "Option C text" },
    { label: "D", description: "Option D text" }
  ]},
  // ... more questions
]})

After user answers, extract their choices and call:
cs_assess_quiz({ answers: "1-A, 2-B, 3-C, ...", topic: "${topic}", stage: "understand" })`
}
